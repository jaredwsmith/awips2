AWIPS contains two methods for saving and loading data resources: **Bundles** are a simple way to save loaded resources to access in future CAVE sessions.  **Procedures** are similar to Bundles, but can be thought of a *groups of bundles* and allows the user to manage saved resources with more control.


##  Bundles

### **File &gt; Open Bundle**

Load a previously-saved bundle from within the AWIPS system.  The Open Bundle dialog allows you to select your own saved bundles as well as those saved by other users.

Each selected bundle will load its contents to new tabs which are named after the bundle file name (e.g. NAM_ThetaE)

Most saved bundles will consist of a single Map Editor (tab), but with multiple tabs saved each will open again in its own Map Editor

### **File &gt; Save Bundle**

Save a product display within the AWIPS system, synching the bundle between CAVE and the EDEX server.

### **File &gt; Delete Bundle**

Select and remove a saved bundle under File &gt; Delete Bundle.  Select the file name and click **OK** and then confirm deletion to remove the saved file permanently.

### Open Procedure

Similar to creating a new Procedure, select **File &gt; Procedures &gt; Open**, select the saved resources and click **Load** to load them to CAVE.

### Delete Procedure

From the menu  **File &gt; Procedures &gt; Delete** you can delete existing Procedure files in a way similar to deleting saved Bundle files.
