      <p>So far, we have only talked about conflicts at the level of
      file content.  When you and your collaborators make overlapping
      changes within the same file, Subversion forces you to merge
      those changes before you can commit.<sup>[<a id="idp33222432" href="#ftn.idp33222432" class="footnote">8</a>]</sup></p>
      <p>But what happens if your collaborators move or delete a file
      that you are still working on?  Maybe there was a
      miscommunication, and one person thinks the file should be
      deleted, while another person still wants to commit changes to
      the file.  Or maybe your collaborators did some refactoring,
      renaming files and moving around directories in the process.  If
      you were still working on these files, those modifications may
      need to be applied to the files at their new location.  Such
      conflicts manifest themselves at the directory tree structure
      level rather than at the file content level, and are known
      as <em class="firstterm">tree conflicts</em>.</p>
      <div class="sidebar" title="Tree conflicts prior to Subversion 1.6">
        <p class="title">
          <b>Tree conflicts prior to Subversion 1.6</b>
        </p>
        <p>Prior to Subversion 1.6, tree conflicts could yield rather
        unexpected results.  For example, if a file was locally
        modified, but had been renamed in the repository,
        running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> would make Subversion
        carry out the following steps:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Check the file to be renamed for local
          modifications.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Delete the file at its old location, and if it
          had local modifications, keep an on-disk copy of the file at
          the old location.  This on-disk copy now appears as an
          unversioned file in the working copy.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Add the file, as it exists in the repository,
          at its new location.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>When this situation arises, there is the possibility that
        the user makes a commit without realizing that local
        modifications have been left in a now-unversioned file in the
        working copy, and have not reached the repository.  This gets
        more and more likely (and tedious) if the number of files
        affected by this problem is large.</p>
        <p>Since Subversion 1.6, this and other similar situations
        are flagged as conflicts in the working copy.</p>
      </div>
      <p>As with textual conflicts, tree conflicts prevent a commit
      from being made from the conflicted state, giving the user the
      opportunity to examine the state of the working copy for
      potential problems arising from the tree conflict, and resolving
      any such problems before committing.</p>
      <div class="sect2" title="An Example Tree Conflict">

        <p>Suppose a software project you were working on currently

        <p>Your collaborator Harry has renamed the file

        </div>
        <p>Note how bar.c is automatically scheduled for re-addition
        in your working copy, which simplifies things in case you want
        to keep the file.</p>
        <p>Because a move in Subversion is implemented as a copy operation
        followed by a delete operation, and these two operations cannot
        be easily related to one another during an update, all Subversion
        can warn you about is an incoming delete operation on a locally
        modified file.
        This delete operation <span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> be part of a move,
        or it could be a genuine delete operation.  Talking to your
        collaborators, or, as a last resort, <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span>,
        is a good way to find out what has actually happened.</p>
        <p>Both <code class="filename">foo.c</code> and <code class="filename">baz.c</code>
        are reported as locally modified in the output of
        <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.  You made the changes to
        <code class="filename">foo.c</code> yourself, so this should not be
        surprising.  But why is <code class="filename">baz.c</code> reported as
        locally modified?</p>
        <p>The answer is that despite the limitations of the move
        implementation, Subversion was smart enough to transfer your
        local edits in <code class="filename">bar.c</code>
        into <code class="filename">baz.c</code>:</p>
