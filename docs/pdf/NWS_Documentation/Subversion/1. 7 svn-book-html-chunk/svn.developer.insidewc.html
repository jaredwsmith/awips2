      <p>As we mentioned earlier, each directory of a Subversion
      working copy contains a special subdirectory called
      <code class="filename">.svn</code> that houses administrative data about
      that working copy directory.  Subversion uses the information in
      <code class="filename">.svn</code> to keep track of things such as:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Which repository location(s) are represented by the
          files and subdirectories in the working copy
          directory</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>What revision of each of those files and directories is
          currently present in the working copy</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Any user-defined properties that might be attached
          to those files and directories</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Pristine (unedited) copies of the working copy
          files</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>The Subversion working copy administration area's layout and
      contents are considered implementation details not really
      intended for human consumption.  Developers are encouraged to
      use Subversion's public APIs, or the tools that Subversion
      provides, to access and manipulate the working copy data,
      instead of directly reading or modifying those files.  The file
      formats employed by the working copy library for its
      administrative data do change from time to time—a fact
      that the public APIs do a great job of hiding from the average
      user.  In this section, we expose some of these implementation
      details sheerly to appease your overwhelming curiosity.</p>
      <div class="sect2" title="The Entries File">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.developer.insidewc.entries"></a>The Entries File</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Perhaps the single most important file in the
        <code class="filename">.svn</code> directory is the
        <code class="filename">entries</code> file.  It
        contains the bulk of the administrative
        information about the versioned items in a working copy
        directory.  This one file tracks the repository
        URLs, pristine revision, file checksums, pristine text and
        property timestamps, scheduling and conflict state
        information, last-known commit information (author, revision,
        timestamp), local copy history—practically everything
        that a Subversion client is interested in knowing about a
        versioned (or to-be-versioned) resource!</p>
        <p>Folks familiar with CVS's administrative directories will
        have recognized at this point that Subversion's
        <code class="filename">.svn/entries</code> file serves the purposes of,
        among other things, CVS's <code class="filename">CVS/Entries</code>,
        <code class="filename">CVS/Root</code>, and
        <code class="filename">CVS/Repository</code> files combined.</p>
        <p>The format of the <code class="filename">.svn/entries</code> file
        has changed over time.  Originally an XML file, it now uses a
        custom—though still human-readable—file format.
        While XML was a great choice for early developers of
        Subversion who were frequently debugging the file's contents
        (and Subversion's behavior in light of them), the need for
        easy developer debugging has diminished as Subversion has
        matured and has been replaced by the user's need for snappier
        performance.  Be aware that Subversion's working copy library
        automatically upgrades working copies from one format to
        another—it reads the old formats and writes the
        new—which saves you the hassle of checking out a new
        working copy, but can also complicate situations where
        different versions of Subversion might be trying to use the
        same working copy.</p>

      <div class="sect2" title="Pristine Copies and Property Files">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.developer.insidewc.base-and-props"></a>Pristine Copies and Property Files</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>As mentioned before, the <code class="filename">.svn</code>
        directory also holds the pristine <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">text-base</span>”</span>
        versions of files.  You can find those in
        <code class="filename">.svn/text-base</code>.  The benefits of these
        pristine copies are multiple—network-free checks for
        local modifications and difference reporting, network-free
        reversion of modified or missing files, more efficient
        transmission of changes to the server—but they come at the
        cost of having each versioned file stored at least twice on
        disk.  These days, this seems to be a negligible penalty for
        most files.  However, the situation gets uglier as the size of
        your versioned files grows.  Some attention is being given to
        making the presence of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">text-base</span>”</span> an option.
        Ironically, though, it is as your versioned files' sizes get
        larger that the existence of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">text-base</span>”</span>
        becomes more crucial—who wants to transmit a huge file
        across a network just because she wants to commit a tiny
        change to it?</p>
        <p>Similar in purpose to the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">text-base</span>”</span> files
        are the property files and their pristine
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">prop-base</span>”</span> copies, located in
        <code class="filename">.svn/props</code> and
        <code class="filename">.svn/prop-base</code>, respectively.  Since
        directories can have properties too, there are also
        <code class="filename">.svn/dir-props</code> and
        <code class="filename">.svn/dir-prop-base</code> files.</p>
