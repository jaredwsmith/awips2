      <p>Here ends the automated magic.  Sooner or later, once you
      get the hang of branching and merging, you're going to have to
      ask Subversion to merge <span class="emphasis"><em>specific</em></span> changes
      from one place to another.  To do this, you're going to
      have to start passing more complicated arguments to <span class="command"><strong>svn
      merge</strong></span>.  The next section describes the fully expanded
      syntax of the command and discusses a number of common
      scenarios that require it.</p>

        <p>Just as the term <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">changeset</span>”</span> is often used in
        version control systems, so is the term
        <em class="firstterm">cherrypicking</em>.  This word refers to
        the act of choosing <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> specific
        changeset from a branch and replicating it to another.
        Cherrypicking may also refer to the act of duplicating a
        particular set of (not necessarily contiguous!) changesets
        from one branch to another.  This is in contrast to more
        typical merging scenarios, where the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">next</span>”</span>
        contiguous range of revisions is duplicated
        automatically.</p>
        <p>Why would people want to replicate just a single change?
        It comes up more often than you'd think.  For example, let's
        go back in time and imagine that you haven't yet merged your
        private feature branch back to the trunk.  At the
        water cooler, you get word that Sally made an interesting
        change to <code class="filename">integer.c</code> on the trunk.
        Looking over the history of commits to the trunk, you see that
        in revision 355 she fixed a critical bug that directly
        impacts the feature you're working on.  You might not be ready
        to merge all the trunk changes to your branch just yet, but
        you certainly need that particular bug fix in order to continue
        your work.</p>

        <p>This use case of replicating
        (or <em class="firstterm">backporting</em>) bug fixes from one
        branch to another is perhaps the most popular reason for
        cherrypicking changes; it comes up all the time, for example,
        when a team is maintaining a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">release branch</span>”</span> of
        software.  (We discuss this pattern in
        <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.html#svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.release" title="Release Branches">the section called “Release Branches”</a>.)</p>

                <p>Did you notice how, in the last example, the merge
          invocation caused two distinct ranges of merges to be
          applied?  The <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> command applied
          two independent patches to your working copy to skip over
          changeset 355, which your branch already contained.  There's
          nothing inherently wrong with this, except that it has the
          potential to make conflict resolution trickier.  If the
          first range of changes creates conflicts,
          you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> resolve them interactively for
          the merge process to continue and apply the second range of
          changes.  If you postpone a conflict from the first wave of
          changes, the whole merge command will bail out with an error
          message.<sup>[<a id="idp36191216" href="#ftn.idp36191216" class="footnote">26</a>]</sup></p>

        <p>A word of warning: while <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> are very similar in concept, they
        do have different syntax in many cases.  Be sure to read about
        them in <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.html" title="Chapter 9. Subversion Complete Reference">Chapter 9, <i>Subversion Complete Reference</i></a> for details, or ask
        <span class="command"><strong>svn help</strong></span>.  For example, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> requires a working copy path as a target, that is,
        a place where it should apply the generated patch.  If the
        target isn't specified, it assumes you are trying to perform
        one of the following common operations:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>You want to merge directory changes into your current
            working directory.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>You want to merge the changes in a specific file into
            a file by the same name that exists in your current working
            directory.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>If you are merging a directory and haven't specified a
        target path, <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> assumes the first
        case and tries to apply the changes into your current
        directory.  If you are merging a file, and that file (or a
        file by the same name) exists in your current working
        directory,
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> assumes the second case and tries
        to apply the changes to a local file with the same name.</p>

        <p>You've now seen some examples of the <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> command, and you're about to see several more.
        If you're feeling confused about exactly how merging works,
        you're not alone.  Many users (especially those new to version
        control) are initially perplexed about the proper syntax of
        the command and about how and when the feature should be
        used.  But fear not, this command is actually much simpler
        than you think!  There's a very easy technique for
        understanding exactly how <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
        behaves.</p>
        <p>The main source of confusion is the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> of the command.  The term
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">merge</span>”</span> somehow denotes that branches are
        combined together, or that some sort of mysterious
        blending of data is going on.  That's not the case.  A better
        name for the command might have been <span class="command"><strong>svn
        diff-and-apply</strong></span>, because that's all that happens:
        two repository trees are compared, and the differences are
        applied to a working copy.</p>
        <p>If you're using <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to do basic
        copying of changes between branches, it will generally do the
        right thing automatically.  For example, a command such as the
        following:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn merge ^/calc/branches/some-branch
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>will attempt to duplicate any changes made
        on <code class="filename">some-branch</code> into your current working
        directory, which is presumably a working copy that shares some
        historical connection to the branch.  The command is smart
        enough to only duplicate changes that your working copy
        doesn't yet have.  If you repeat this command once a week, it
        will only duplicate the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">newest</span>”</span> branch changes
        that happened since you last merged.</p>
        <p>If you choose to use the <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
        command in all its full glory by giving it specific revision
        ranges to duplicate, the command takes three main
        arguments:</p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>An initial repository tree (often called the
            <em class="firstterm">left side</em> of the comparison)</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>A final repository tree (often called the
            <em class="firstterm">right side</em> of the
            comparison)</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>A working copy to accept the differences as local
            changes (often called the <em class="firstterm">target</em> of
            the merge)</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Once these three arguments are specified, the two trees
        are compared, and the differences are applied to the
        target working copy as local modifications.  When the command
        is done, the results are no different than if you had
        hand-edited the files or run various <span class="command"><strong>svn
        add</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span> commands
        yourself.  If you like the results, you can commit them.  If
        you don't like the results, you can simply <span class="command"><strong>svn
        revert</strong></span> all of the changes.</p>
        <p>The syntax of <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> allows you to
        specify the three necessary arguments rather flexibly.  Here
        are some examples:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/branch1@150 \
            http://svn.example.com/repos/branch2@212 \
            my-working-copy

$ svn merge -r 100:200 http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk my-working-copy

$ svn merge -r 100:200 http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>The first syntax lays out all three arguments explicitly,
        naming each tree in the form <span class="emphasis"><em>URL@REV</em></span> and
        naming the working copy target.  The second syntax can be used
        as a shorthand for situations when you're comparing two
        different revisions of the same URL.  The last syntax shows
        how the working copy argument is optional; if omitted, it
        defaults to the current directory.</p>
        <p>While the first example shows the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">full</span>”</span>
        syntax of <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>, it needs to be used
        very carefully;  it can result in merges which do not record
        any <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> metadata at all.  The
        next section talks a bit more about this.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="Merges Without Mergeinfo">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Subversion tries to generate merge metadata whenever it
        can, to make future invocations of <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> smarter.  There are still situations, however,
        where <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> data is not created or
        changed.  Remember to be a bit wary of these scenarios:</p>
        <div class="variablelist">

              <p>If you ask <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to compare
              two URLs that aren't related to each other, a patch will
              still be generated and applied to your working copy, but
              no merging metadata will be created.  There's no common
              history between the two sources, and
              future <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">smart</span>”</span> merges depend on that common
              history.</p>

              <em class="replaceable"><code>http://svn.foreignproject.com/repos/trunk</code></em></code></strong>,
              the resultant patch will also lack any historical merge
              metadata.  At time of this writing, Subversion has no
              way of representing different repository URLs within
              the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property.</p>

              apply a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">reverse patch</span>”</span> as a way of rolling
              back changes.  If this technique is used to undo a
              change to an object's personal history (e.g., commit r5
              to the trunk, then immediately roll back r5

            <b>Natural History and Implicit Mergeinfo</b>
          </p>
          <p>When a path has the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code>
          property set on it we say it has <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">explicit</span>”</span>
          mergeinfo.  Yes, this implies a path can
          have <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">implicit</span>”</span> mergeinfo, too!  Implicit
          mergeinfo, or <em class="firstterm">natural history</em>, is
          simply a path's own history (see
          <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.history.html" title="Examining History">the section called “Examining History”</a>) interpreted as merge
          tracking information.  While implicit mergeinfo is largely
          an implementation detail, it can be a useful abstraction for
          understanding merge tracking behavior.</p>
          <p>Let's say you created <code class="filename">^/trunk</code> in
          revision 100 and then later, in revision 201,
          created <code class="filename">^/branches/feature-branch</code> as
          a copy of <code class="filename">^/trunk@200</code>.  The natural
          history of <code class="filename">^/branches/feature-branch</code>
          contains all the repository paths and revision ranges
          through which the history of the new branch has ever
          passed:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <div class="literallayout">
              <p><br />
/trunk:100-200<br />
/branches/feature-branch:201<br />
</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>With each new revision added to the repository, the
          natural history—and thus, implicit mergeinfo—of
          the branch continues to expand to include those revisions
          until the day the branch is deleted.  Here's what the
          implicit mergeinfo of our branch would look like when
          the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision of the repository had
          grown to 234:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <div class="literallayout">
              <p><br />
/trunk:100-200<br />
/branches/feature-branch:201-234<br />
</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Implicit mergeinfo does not actually show up in the
          <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property, but Subversion
          acts as if it does.  This is why if you check out
          <code class="filename">^/branches/feature-branch</code> and then
          run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn merge ^/trunk -c 58</code></strong> in the
          resulting working copy, nothing happens.  Subversion knows
          that the changes committed to <code class="filename">^/trunk</code>
          in revision 58 are already present in the target's natural
          history, so there's no need to try to merge them again.
          After all, avoiding repeated merges of
          changes <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> the primary goal of
          Subversion's merge tracking feature!</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Just like the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> command,
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> applies changes to your working
        copy.  And therefore it's also capable of creating
        conflicts.  The conflicts produced by <span class="command"><strong>svn
          merge</strong></span>, however, are sometimes different, and this
        section explains those differences.</p>
        <p>To begin with, assume that your working copy has no
        local edits.  When you <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to a
        particular revision, the changes sent by the server will
        always apply <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cleanly</span>”</span> to your working copy.
        The server produces the delta by comparing two trees: a
        virtual snapshot of your working copy, and the revision tree
        you're interested in.  Because the left hand side of the
        comparison is exactly equal to what you already have, the
        delta is guaranteed to correctly convert your working copy
        into the right hand tree.</p>
        <p>But <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> has no such guarantees
        and can be much more chaotic: the advanced user can ask the
        server to compare <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> two trees at all,
        even ones that are unrelated to the working copy!  This means
        there's large potential for human error.  Users will sometimes
        compare the wrong two trees, creating a delta that doesn't
        apply cleanly.  <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> will do its best
        to apply as much of the delta as possible, but some parts may
        be impossible.  Just as the Unix
        <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> command sometimes complains about
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">failed hunks,</span>”</span> <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> will
        similarly complain about <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">skipped
        targets</span>”</span>:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn merge -r 1288:1351 http://svn.example.com/myrepos/branch
U    foo.c
U    bar.c
Skipped missing target: 'baz.c'
U    glub.c
U    sputter.h

Conflict discovered in 'glorb.h'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (mc) mine-conflict, (tc) theirs-conflict,
        (s) show all options: 
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>In the previous example, it might be the case that
        <code class="filename">baz.c</code> exists in both snapshots of the
        branch being compared, and the resultant delta wants to
        change the file's contents, but the file doesn't exist in
        the working copy.  Whatever the case, the
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">skipped</span>”</span> message means that the user is most
        likely comparing the wrong two trees; it's the classic
        sign of user error.  When this happens, it's easy to
        recursively revert all the changes created by the merge
        (<strong class="userinput"><code>svn revert . --recursive</code></strong>), delete any
        unversioned files or directories left behind after the
        revert, and rerun <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> with
        different arguments.</p>
        <p>Also notice that the preceding example shows a conflict
        happening on <code class="filename">glorb.h</code>.  We already
        stated that the working copy has no local edits: how can a
        conflict possibly happen?  Again, because the user can use
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to define and apply any old
        delta to the working copy, that delta may contain textual
        changes that don't cleanly apply to a working file, even if
        the file has no local modifications.</p>
        <p>Another small difference between <span class="command"><strong>svn
        update</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> is the names
        of the full-text files created when a conflict happens.  In
        <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve" title="Resolve Any Conflicts">the section called “Resolve Any Conflicts”</a>, we saw that an
        update produces files named
        <code class="filename">filename.mine</code>,
        <code class="filename">filename.rOLDREV</code>, and
        <code class="filename">filename.rNEWREV</code>.  When <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> produces a conflict, though, it creates three
        files named <code class="filename">filename.working</code>,
        <code class="filename">filename.left</code>, and
        <code class="filename">filename.right</code>.  In this case, the
        terms <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">left</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">right</span>”</span> are
        describing which side of the double-tree comparison the file
        came from.  In any case, these differing names will help you
        distinguish between conflicts that happened as a result of an
        update and ones that happened as a result of a
        merge.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Sometimes there's a particular changeset that you don't
        want to be automatically merged.  For example, perhaps your
        team's policy is to do new development work on
        <code class="filename">/trunk</code>, but to be more conservative about
        backporting changes to a stable branch you use for releasing
        to the public.  On one extreme, you can manually cherrypick
        single changesets from the trunk to the branch—just the
        changes that are stable enough to pass muster.  Maybe things
        aren't quite that strict, though; perhaps most of the time
        you'd like to just let <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
        automatically merge most changes from trunk to branch.  In
        this case, you'd like a way to mask a few specific changes
        out, that is, prevent them from ever being automatically
        merged.</p>
        <p>In Subversion 1.6, the only way to block a changeset is to
        make the system believe that the change has
        <span class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> been merged.  To do this, invoke
        a merge command with the <code class="option">--record-only</code>
        option:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ cd my-calc-branch

$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:1680-3305

# Let's make the metadata list r3328 as already merged.
$ svn merge -c 3328 --record-only ^/calc/trunk

$ svn status
M       .

$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:1680-3305,3328

$ svn commit -m "Block r3328 from being merged to the branch."
…
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This technique works, but it's also a little bit
        dangerous.  The main problem is that we're not clearly
        differentiating between the ideas of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I already have
        this change</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I don't have this change, but
        don't currently want it.</span>”</span> We're effectively lying to
        the system, making it think that the change was previously
        merged.  This puts the responsibility on you—the
        user—to remember that the change wasn't actually merged,
        it just wasn't wanted.  There's no way to ask Subversion for a
        list of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">blocked changelists.</span>”</span> If you want to
        track them (so that you can unblock them someday) you'll need
        to record them in a text file somewhere, or perhaps in an
        invented property.</p>

      <div class="sect2" title="Keeping a Reintegrated Branch Alive">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.advanced.reintegratetwice"></a>Keeping a Reintegrated Branch Alive</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>There is an alternative to destroying and re-creating a
        branch after reintegration. To understand why it works you need
        to understand why the branch is initially unfit for further use
        after it has been reintegrated.</p>
        <p>Let's assume you created your branch in revision
        <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>. While working on your branch, you created
        one or more revisions which made changes to the branch.
        Before reintegrating your branch into trunk, you made a final
        merge from trunk to your branch, and committed the result of
        this merge as revision <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>.</p>
        <p>When reintegrating your branch into the trunk, you create
        a new revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> which changes the trunk.
        The changes made to trunk in this revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>
        are semantically equivalent to the changes you made to your branch
        between revisions <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>.
        </p>
        <p>If you now try to merge outstanding changes from trunk to your
        branch, Subversion will consider changes made in revision
        <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> as eligible for being merged into the
        branch. However, since your branch already contains all the
        changes made in revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, merging these
        changes can result in spurious conflicts! These conflicts are
        often tree conflicts, especially if renames were made on the
        branch or the trunk while the branch was in development.</p>
        <p>So what can be done about this? We need to make sure that
        Subversion does not try to merge revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>
        into the branch. This can be done using the
        <code class="option">--record-only</code> merge option, which was introduced
        in <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.advanced.html#svn.branchmerge.advanced.blockchanges" title="Blocking Changes">the section called “Blocking Changes”</a>.</p>
        <p>To carry out the record-only merge, get a working copy of
        the branch which was just reintegrated in revision
        <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, and merge just revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>
        from trunk into your branch, making sure to use the
        <code class="option">--record-only</code> option.</p>
        <p>This merge uses the cherry-picking merge syntax, which was
        introduced in <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.advanced.html#svn.branchmerge.cherrypicking" title="Cherrypicking">the section called “Cherrypicking”</a>.
        Continuing with the running example from
        <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.html#svn.branchemerge.basicmerging.reintegrate" title="Reintegrating a Branch">the section called “Reintegrating a Branch”</a>,
        where revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> was revision 391:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ cd my-calc-branch
$ svn update
Updating '.':
Updated to revision 393.
$ svn merge --record-only -c 391 ^/calc/trunk
$ svn commit -m "Block revision 391 from being merged into my-calc-branch."
Sending        .

Committed revision 394.
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Now your branch is ready to soak up changes from the trunk
        again. After another sync of your branch to the trunk, you can
        even reintegrate the branch a second time.
        If necessary, you can do another record-only merge to keep the
        branch alive. Rinse and repeat.</p>
        <p>It should now also be apparent why deleting the branch and
        re-creating it has the same effect as doing the above record-only
        merge. Because revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> is part of the natural
        history of the newly created branch, Subversion will never attempt to
        merge revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> into the branch, avoiding
        spurious conflicts.</p>
      </div>

        </div>
        <p>One of the main features of any version control system is
        to keep track of who changed what, and when they did it.
        The <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        blame</strong></span> commands are just the tools for this: when
        invoked on individual files, they show not only the history of
        changesets that affected the file, but also exactly which user
        wrote which line of code, and when she did it.</p>
        <p>When changes start getting replicated between branches,
        however, things start to get complicated.  For example, if you
        were to ask <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> about the history of
        your feature branch, it would show exactly every revision that ever
        affected the branch:</p>

        <p>By making the log operation use merge history, we see not
        just the revision we queried (r390), but also the two revisions
        that came along on the ride with it—a couple of changes
        made by Sally to the trunk.  This is a much more complete
        picture of history!</p>
        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn blame</strong></span> command also takes the
        <code class="option">--use-merge-history</code> (<code class="option">-g</code>)
        option.  If this option is neglected, somebody looking at
        a line-by-line annotation of <code class="filename">button.c</code> may
        get the mistaken impression that you were responsible for the
        lines that fixed a certain error:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn blame button.c
…
   390    user    retval = inverse_func(button, path);
   390    user    return retval;
   390    user    }
…
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>And while it's true that you did actually commit those
        three lines in revision 390, two of them were actually written
        by Sally back in revision 383:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn blame button.c -g
…
G    383    sally   retval = inverse_func(button, path);
G    383    sally   return retval;
     390    user    }
…
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Now we know who to <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> blame for
        those two lines of code!</p>

        <p>When conversing with a Subversion developer, you might
        very likely hear reference to the term
        <em class="firstterm">ancestry</em>.  This word is used to
        describe the relationship between two objects in a
        repository: if they're related to each other, one
        object is said to be an ancestor of the other.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose you commit revision 100, which
        includes a change to a file <code class="filename">foo.c</code>.
        Then <code class="filename">foo.c@99</code> is an
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">ancestor</span>”</span> of <code class="filename">foo.c@100</code>.
        On the other hand, suppose you commit the deletion of
        <code class="filename">foo.c</code> in revision 101, and then add a
        new file by the same name in revision 102.  In this case,
        <code class="filename">foo.c@99</code> and
        <code class="filename">foo.c@102</code> may appear to be related
        (they have the same path), but in fact are completely
        different objects in the repository.  They share no history
        or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">ancestry.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The reason for bringing this up is to point out an
        important difference between <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>.  The former command ignores
        ancestry, while the latter command is quite sensitive to it.
        For example, if you asked <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> to
        compare revisions 99 and 102 of <code class="filename">foo.c</code>,
        you would see line-based diffs; the <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span>
        command is blindly comparing two paths.  But if you asked
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to compare the same two objects,
        it would notice that they're unrelated and first attempt to
        delete the old file, then add the new file;  the output would
        indicate a deletion followed by an add:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
D    foo.c
A    foo.c
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Most merges involve comparing trees that are ancestrally
        related to one another; therefore, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> defaults to this behavior.  Occasionally,
        however, you may want the <span class="command"><strong>merge</strong></span> command to
        compare two unrelated trees.  For example, you may have
        imported two source-code trees representing different vendor
        releases of a software project (see
        <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.vendorbr.html" title="Vendor Branches">the section called “Vendor Branches”</a>).  If you ask
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to compare the two trees, you'd
        see the entire first tree being deleted, followed by an add
        of the entire second tree!  In these situations, you'll want
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to do a path-based comparison
        only, ignoring any relations between files and directories.
        Add the <code class="option">--ignore-ancestry</code> option to your
        <span class="command"><strong>merge</strong></span> command, and it will behave just
        like <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>.  (And conversely, the
        <code class="option">--notice-ancestry</code> option will cause
        <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> to behave like the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> command.)</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>A common desire is to refactor source code, especially
        in Java-based software projects.  Files and directories are
        shuffled around and renamed, often causing great disruption
        to everyone working on the project.  Sounds like a perfect
        case to use a branch, doesn't it?  Just create a branch,
        shuffle things around, and then merge the branch back to the
        trunk, right?</p>
        <p>Alas, this scenario doesn't work so well right now and
        is considered one of Subversion's current weak spots.  The
        problem is that Subversion's <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>
        command isn't as robust as it should be, particularly when
        dealing with copy and move operations.</p>
        <p>When you use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> to duplicate a
        file, the repository remembers where the new file came from,
        but it fails to transmit that information to the client which
        is running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span>.  Instead of telling the client, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Copy
        that file you already have to this new location,</span>”</span> it
        sends down an entirely new file.  This can lead to
        problems, especially because the same thing happens with
        renamed files.  A lesser-known fact about Subversion is that
        it lacks <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">true renames</span>”</span>—the <span class="command"><strong>svn
        move</strong></span> command is nothing more than an aggregation
        of <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        delete</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose that while working on your private
        branch, you rename <code class="filename">integer.c</code>
        to <code class="filename">whole.c</code>.  Effectively you've created
        a new file in your branch that is a copy of the original
        file, and deleted the original file.  Meanwhile, back
        on <code class="filename">trunk</code>, Sally has committed some
        improvements to <code class="filename">integer.c</code>.  Now you
        decide to merge your branch to the trunk:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ cd calc/trunk

$ svn merge --reintegrate ^/calc/branches/my-calc-branch
--- Merging differences between repository URLs into '.':
D   integer.c
A   whole.c
U   .
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This doesn't look so bad at first glance, but it's also
        probably not what you or Sally expected.  The merge operation
        has deleted the latest version of
        the <code class="filename">integer.c</code> file (the one containing
        Sally's latest changes), and blindly added your
        new <code class="filename">whole.c</code> file—which is a
        duplicate of the <span class="emphasis"><em>older</em></span> version
        of <code class="filename">integer.c</code>.  The net effect is that
        merging your <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">rename</span>”</span> to the trunk has removed
        Sally's recent changes from the latest revision!</p>
        <p>This isn't true data loss.  Sally's changes are still in
        the repository's history, but it may not be immediately
        obvious that this has happened.  The moral of this story is
        that until Subversion improves, be very careful about
        merging copies and renames from one branch to
        another.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>If you've just upgraded your server to Subversion 1.5 or
        later, there's a significant risk that pre-1.5 Subversion
        clients can mess up your automated merge tracking.  Why is
        this?  When a pre-1.5 Subversion client performs <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span>, it doesn't modify the value of
        the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property at all.  So the
        subsequent commit, despite being the result of a merge,
        doesn't tell the repository about the duplicated
        changes—that information is lost.  Later on,
        when <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">merge-aware</span>”</span> clients attempt automatic
        merging, they're likely to run into all sorts of conflicts
        resulting from repeated merges.</p>
        <p>If you and your team are relying on the merge-tracking
        features of Subversion, you may want to configure your
        repository to prevent older clients from committing changes.
        The easy way to do this is by inspecting
        the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">capabilities</span>”</span> parameter in
        the <code class="literal">start-commit</code> hook script.  If the
        client reports itself as having <code class="literal">mergeinfo</code>
        capabilities, the hook script can allow the commit to start.
        If the client doesn't report that capability, have the hook
        deny the commit.

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The bottom line is that Subversion's merge-tracking
        feature has an extremely complex internal implementation, and
        the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property is the only
        window the user has into the machinery.  Because the feature
        is relatively new, a numbers of edge cases and
        possible unexpected behaviors may pop up.</p>
        <p>Sometimes mergeinfo will appear on files that you didn't
        expect to be touched by an operation.  Sometimes mergeinfo
        won't be generated at all, when you expect it to.
        Furthermore, the management of mergeinfo metadata has a whole
        set of taxonomies and behaviors around it, such
        as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">explicit</span>”</span> versus <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">implicit</span>”</span>
        mergeinfo, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">operative</span>”</span>
        versus <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">inoperative</span>”</span> revisions, specific
        mechanisms of mergeinfo <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">elision,</span>”</span> and
        even <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">inheritance</span>”</span> from parent to child
        directories.</p>
        <p>We've chosen not to cover these detailed topics in this
        book for a couple of reasons.  First, the level of detail is
        absolutely overwhelming for a typical user.  Second, as
        Subversion continues to improve, we feel that a typical user
        <span class="emphasis"><em>shouldn't</em></span> have to understand these
        concepts; they'll eventually fade into the background as pesky
        implementation details.  All that said, if you enjoy this sort
        of thing, you can get a fantastic overview in a paper posted
        at CollabNet's website: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/community/subversion/articles/merge-info.html" target="_top">http://www.collab.net/community/subversion/articles/merge-info.html</a>.</p>
        <p>For now, if you want to steer clear of bugs and odd
        behaviors in automatic merging, the CollabNet article
